            WEEKEND TOURS
        </h3>
        <p>
            On weekends and certain holidays, we still conduct our full 40-minute guided factory tours, but since our candy makers are at home with their families, 
            we give our candy making machines a rest. Video monitors show the different steps of our famous candy making process as you walk through the route.
        </p>
