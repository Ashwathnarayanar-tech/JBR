            For the candy lover who seeks the exclusive and personal travel experience, the Jelly Belly Visitor Center in Fairfield, California, offers a behind-the-scenes factory tour. 
            The guided tour leads visitors through the factory for an up close and personal experience like no other. Limited to 6 (six) participants, the Jelly Belly University (JBU) 
            tour gives fans a real education on how American's favorite gourmet jelly bean is made.

        <p>
            Participants will be given lab coats, gloves and hair nets before setting out on the guided tour; and will soon find themselves in the heart of the factory and watch while master 
            confectioners create Jelly Belly and other delicious confections.
        </p>

            At the end of the JBU tour, which can take over one hour, visitors will receive a discount on a souvenir photo and a discount card for shopping in the retail store.
